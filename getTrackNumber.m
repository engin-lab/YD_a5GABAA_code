% This a helper method that returns track number at given position
% author: Zhaonan Li
% input: position of the animal
% output: the track number n that the animal is currently located, 1<=f<=4
%         or 0, indicating the animal has returned home
%         [updated] or -1, indicating the animal has not reached one of the arms,
%         between home and center point
%         [updated] or -2, indicating the animal has not reached one of the
%         arms, bewteen center point and reward area
